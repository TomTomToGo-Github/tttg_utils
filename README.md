# tttg_licences
Handle licencing for software or apps.

This package is designed to manage license keys (create, store in db, check validity)

Basic usage:

```
tttg_utils.licensing.license_handler_classes import LicenseHandler

user_name = 'new_name'
purchased_months = 2
license_generator = LicenseHandler()
new_key = license_generator.generate_new_license_key(user_name, purchased_months)
print(new_key)
```



## Info
Implementing licenses for a software product involves creating a mechanism to control access to the software, enforce usage restrictions, and track licensing compliance. Below are high-level instructions and code examples for implementing licenses in a software product. The specific implementation details may vary depending on the programming language and framework you are using.

## Step 1: Define License Types

Determine the types of licenses you want to offer (e.g., trial, free, paid, enterprise). Each license type may have different features, restrictions, and pricing.

## Step 2: Generate License Keys

Create a system for generating unique license keys for each customer. You can use cryptographic techniques to ensure the keys are secure and tamper-proof.

Here's a Python example of generating a simple license key:

##  Step 3: Validate License Keys

When a user installs your software, they should enter their license key. You must validate the key to determine if it's valid and whether it's expired or not.


## Step 4: License Activation

When the user enters a valid license key, activate the software for their use. You can do this by storing the activation status in a file or database.

## Step 5: Check License Status

At runtime, your software should regularly check the license status to ensure it's still valid. If it expires or violates any restrictions, take appropriate actions (e.g., disable certain features or prompt the user to renew the license).


## Step 6: Handle License Renewals

Implement a mechanism for users to renew their licenses when they expire. You can send reminders and provide an interface for license renewal.

## Step 7: Reporting and Analytics

Collect data on license usage, activations, and user behavior to monitor compliance and make informed decisions.

## Step 8: Protect License Keys

Store and transmit license keys securely to prevent piracy. Use encryption and obfuscation techniques to make it difficult for unauthorized users to reverse engineer or steal keys.

These are the basic steps to implement licenses for a software product. The actual implementation will depend on your software's architecture, technology stack, and business requirements. Consider consulting with a legal expert to ensure your licenses comply with relevant laws and regulations.
